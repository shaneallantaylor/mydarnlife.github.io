        <p>I started learning guitar at age nine. I played things like Red River
Valley and the Marines Hymn. I paid my dues. At age fifteen, I took
my Allman Brothers at Fillmore East album to my East York guitar
teacher, and he changed my life. He taught me licks from Stormy
Monday and In Memory of Elizabeth Reed. But I really wasn’t cut out
for lead guitar and couldn’t afford the equipment. I stuck with
acoustic guitars and mandolin, and even a little banjo briefly. I
couldn’t play sports or get girls, but I could I could jam with other
losers and play acoustic music, smoke pot, and drink beer. I did that
through high school and college and into my thirties. I loved playing
with friends and absolutely hated playing in front of other people, who
I felt didn’t understand anything. I tried to tackle this neurosis head
on when I joined the Slim Jims in the early 90s and performed
country and “alt country” music in and around Arlington, Virginia and

D.C. I loved practicing and hated performing. My friends once
accurately described my singing as sounding like a “cat on fire”. I
couldn’t breathe through my nose, but I sure could sing through it. I
never played Stairway to Heaven in front of another human. I
conquered Mississippi John Hurt but fell short of the Reverend Gary
Davis. I wrote an awesome Christmas trucker song. I did okay, but
moved on to other creative things and closed the guitar cases. I
guess I had issues. Still do, I suppose.</p>
